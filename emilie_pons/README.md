######### Currently working on the podcast player... but stopped working on it...as I need to evaluate my work before moving forward

##Questions:

1- I'm working on this project to be a template. I am looking for best practice setup and structure for future projects.
2- Should I link Podcasts from iTunes/Spotify or use DB to store them.
3- Also for Video and Youtube? Linked ?
4- Articles and Posts? They are available on other websites. Should I use Cards to display a pic and a bit af info and link to an outside source?

I am not sure if these approaches are personal preference or is there a best pracice apporach to setting the app up?
